% Program that test calculator output based on milliwats

% For CSCI 4220

%Improvements:
%Make Positive and negitive array the same thing and map to -999 etc.
%Thoughts:
%This program goes maps the positive and negitive numbers and depending
%on your operator you may need to check for negitives on the lhs or rhs.

%TODO: Make this program count solutions.
