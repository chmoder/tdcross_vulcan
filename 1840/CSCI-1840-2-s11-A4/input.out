The Mason–Dixon Line (or Mason and Dixon's Line) was 
surveyed between 1763 and 1767 by Charles Mason and 
Jeremiah Dixon in the resolution of a border dispute 
between British colonies in Colonial America. It forms a 
demarcation line among four U.S. states, forming part of 
the borders of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and West 
Virginia (then part of Virginia). In popular usage, 
especially since the Missouri Compromise of 1820 
(apparently the first official use of the term "Mason's and 
Dixon's Line"), the Mason–Dixon Line symbolizes a 
cultural boundary between the Northeastern United States 
and the Southern United States (Dixie).
